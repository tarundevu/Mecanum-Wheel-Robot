<h2 align="center"> Introduction </h2>
<p> This project is about an autonomous 4-wheeled mecanum robot.
It is controlled by a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino
Leonardo that is included in the DFRobot Raspberry Pi Expansion shield.
The task of the robot is to navigate autonomously within an area
while avoiding obtacles using the A* pathfinding algorithm. In the future,
the robot might use ultrasonic sensor or computer vision to create a map of
the environment.
